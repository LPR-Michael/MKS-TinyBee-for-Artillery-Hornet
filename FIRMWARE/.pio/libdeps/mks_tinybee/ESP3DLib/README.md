## Coming Features
As side project of ESP3D, it follows ESP3D features: https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D/blob/3.0/ESP3D-features.xls?raw=true

## How to enable ?
In Marlin configuration files :  
[Configuration.h](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/blob/bugfix-2.0.x/Marlin/Configuration.h) 

Select an ESP32 based board.   

Uncomment the second serial port to allow esp3d to get all printer feedback 
```
/**
 * Select a secondary serial port on the board to use for communication with the host.
 * :[-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
 */
#define SERIAL_PORT_2 -1
```

[Configuration_adv.h](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/blob/bugfix-2.0.x/Marlin/Configuration_adv.h)  

enable `#define ESP3D_WIFISUPPORT   // ESP3D Library WiFi management (https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3DLib)`    

Define to which access point your board need to connect to:
```
  #define WIFI_SSID "Wifi SSID"
  #define WIFI_PWD  "Wifi Password"
```
if not defined or you left like this the board will act as an Access Point instead.

and finally
```
#define WEBSUPPORT          // Start a webserver (which may include auto-discovery)
#define OTASUPPORT          // Support over-the-air firmware updates
#define WIFI_CUSTOM_COMMAND // Accept feature config commands (e.g., WiFi ESP3D) from the host
```


For advanced configuration add in same section:

to enable this feature which is disabled by default:
```
//AUTHENTICATION_FEATURE: protect pages by login password.
#define AUTHENTICATION_FEATURE
```

//in web browser by default: http:\\marlinesp.local and connect
